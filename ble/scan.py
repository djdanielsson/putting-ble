"""
BLE Device Characteristics Explorer

This script uses the Bleak library to scan for BLE devices that match a specified name pattern,
then lists all the GATT services, characteristics, and descriptors for the discovered device,
including their properties and values (if readable). The output is formatted for improved
human readability.

The script requires a regular expression pattern as an input argument to match the BLE device name.
If the device is not found within the number of specified attempts, the script exits.

Usage:
    python scan.py <device_name_pattern>

Arguments:
    device_name_pattern: A regular expression pattern to match against the names of BLE devices.

Example:
    python scan.py "^PL2B.*" # This will match any device name starting with 'PL2B'.

The script will attempt to find the device up to 5 times before giving up. If a device is found,
it will connect and list all available services, characteristics along with their values if they
are readable, and descriptors.

Note:
    This script is intended for educational and diagnostic purposes. It may not work with all
    BLE devices, and the interpretation of the characteristic values is left to the user.
